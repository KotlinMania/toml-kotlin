This is a Kotlin Multiplatform line-by-line transliteration port of [`toml-rs/toml`](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml).

**Original Project:** This port is based on [`toml-rs/toml`](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml). All design credit and project intent belong to the upstream authors; this repository is a faithful port to Kotlin Multiplatform with no behavioural changes intended.

### Porting status

This is an **in-progress port**. The goal is feature parity with the upstream Rust crate while providing a native Kotlin Multiplatform API. Every Kotlin file carries a `// port-lint: source <path>` header naming its upstream Rust counterpart so the AST-distance tool can track provenance.

## Upstream README — `toml-rs/toml`

> The text below is reproduced and lightly edited from [`https://github.com/toml-rs/toml`](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml). It is the upstream project's own description and remains under the upstream authors' authorship; links have been rewritten to absolute upstream URLs so they continue to resolve from this repository.

This repo contains:
- [`toml` crate](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/blob/HEAD/crates/toml) for serde support
- [`toml_edit` crate](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/blob/HEAD/crates/toml_edit) for format-preserving editing of TOML
- [`toml_datetime` crate](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/blob/HEAD/crates/toml_datetime) for a common type definition between `toml` and `toml_edit`
- [`serde_spanned` crate](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/blob/HEAD/crates/serde_spanned) for capturing spans when deserializing keys and values
- [`toml_parser` crate](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/blob/HEAD/crates/toml_parser): a low-level format-preserving TOML lexer and parser
- [`toml_writer` crate](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/blob/HEAD/crates/toml_writer): a low-level interface for writing out TOML
